# Project Title: Customer Review Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates a sentiment analysis pipeline for customer reviews, classifying them as positive or negative. It showcases a two-stage approach: a classical machine learning model for a baseline, and a modern transformer-based model for state-of-the-art performance.

## Key Results

### Classical Model (Logistic Regression with TF-IDF)

Achieved an impressive F1-score of 0.89 and an overall accuracy of 89%. This strong baseline confirms the project's foundational robustness.
